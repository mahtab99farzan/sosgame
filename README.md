The manner in which humans operate has been influenced by networking, which revolutionised the operations of humans. The **SOS game** demonstrates such operations that occur between humans, as proposed by the Ten Eleven Games. The goal of the project was to create a simple, well-known game that can be played over the server. 

### Below are two main tasks that will be discussed in this report:
- Development of the SOS Text-Based Client (code)
- Development of the Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The report will entail the design, implementation and testing phases, emphasising on the structure of the code as the foundation for future versions of this program.
